Begin by installing Jenkins on an EC2 instance. After installation, configure Jenkins to be accessible from the internet, allowing remote access. This involves setting up the necessary security groups and network configurations. Instead of using traditional virtual machines, opt for Docker containers as Jenkins agents. Utilizing Docker also simplifies the process of maintaining consistent environments and dependencies across builds, leading to more reliable and faster CI/CD pipelines.
